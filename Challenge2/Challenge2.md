## Problem Description

Make a dice rolling game.  The screen should display:

* 3 dice
* A button that says "Roll!"
* A button that says "End Round"
* A label with the user's score
* **Optional** A label for High Score (see Bonus)

### Rules:

1. Tapping (or clicking) the Roll button should randomly change the Dice that are not locked down.
  *(yeah, I said Dice and not Die for a single Dice...)*
2. After the first roll a user can tap a dice to lock the face value.
3. After the first round, the **End Round** button will be displayed by the Roll button
4. Tapping the **End Round** button will add the face value of all dice matching the locked dice.
5. If the user rolls a 3 then their score for that round will be 0.  Their total score will start over at 0 as well.
  A new round will start.

## Example

User opens the app. All the dice start at 1. The user can not lock down any dice until they tap **Roll!**.
They Tap Roll! and the dice are randomly changed to the values 2, 5, 6.
The user locks down the 6 dice and rolls again.
The dice that were 2, and 5 are randomly changed to 1 and 6.  The user locks down the 6 dice and taps **End Round**.

Because there were two matching dice locked down, their total value (6+6) are added to the user's score of 0.
The dice all start back at 1 and the **End Round** button is hidden.
The user taps **Roll!** and the dice randomly change to 5, 6, and 6.
The user locks down the two 6 dice and taps **Roll!** again.  The dice with the value of 5 is randomly changed to 3.
Rolling a 3 ends the game, resetting the user's score back to 0.
The dice are set back to 1 and the **End Round** button is hidden.
