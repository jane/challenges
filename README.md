# Jane Weekly Dev Challenges

## Rules

1. Developer Challenges are optional.  If you don't have time to do a task, don't feel like you have to do it.
2. The challenges should not take any longer than 60 minutes to complete.  If you hit 60 minutes, you should stop and share what you have.
3. Solutions (complete or works-in-progress) should be posted in this repo.
4. New Challenges will be added to this repo on Friday morning.


## Posting your code:

Each challenge will have it's own folder, which will have a `README.md` explaining the challenge and include any files needed to complete the challenge.

Once you complete your challenge (or hit the 60 minute limit), create a folder in the challenge with your name.  With in that folder you can post your solution.  You can include a `README.md` to keep track of any additional info you would like (I.E., time to run, lessons learned, etc).

Example:
